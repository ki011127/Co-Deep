The key to the method involved a marionette mechanism, which was ingeniously used to strangle Nobukazu. The setup involved attaching ropes to strategic points within the warehouse, creating a web-like structure. Nobukazu was lured into a specific position where the mechanism could be activated remotely. By using a truck to apply tension to the ropes, the perpetrator was able to strangle Nobukazu and then suspend his body to mimic a spider's web. To add to the illusion of an impenetrable locked room, the ropes were rigged to break under the strain, leaving no direct evidence of their manipulation. The BB gun used to shoot pellets and distract Nobukazu during the setup was discarded in the nearby mountains to eliminate any trace of the device.",
      "motive": "The motive for Nobukazu's murder stemmed from Robert Taylor's deep-seated desire for revenge. Robert had developed a close and affectionate relationship with Misa Takeda during his previous stay at the Takeda Mansion. Misa's untimely death, which Robert believed was a direct result of Nobukazu's abusive behavior and harsh treatment, fueled his anger and grief. He was determined to avenge Misa's death by punishing the person he held responsible. This intense emotional turmoil and sense of justice drove Robert to meticulously plan and execute Nobukazu's murder, ensuring that the punishment fit the perceived crime.",

    {
      "crime": "Toyama Kazuha's Attack",
      "method": "The attack on Toyama Kazuha was carefully orchestrated to not only incapacitate her but also to create a misleading scenario for the investigators. The perpetrator, aware of Kazuha's search for her lost phone charm, saw an opportunity to isolate and attack her. Using a stun gun, the assailant approached Kazuha from behind, delivering a sudden and powerful shock that rendered her unconscious almost instantly. After ensuring that Kazuha was incapacitated, the perpetrator used fishing line to tie her up, creating a scene that mimicked the earlier murder setup. The noose around Kazuha's neck was positioned in such a way as to suggest an imminent hanging, although the true intent was to mislead and confuse the investigators. This careful staging was intended to make it appear as if Kazuha was about to become another victim of the 'spider's web,' thereby adding to the overall narrative of fear and supernatural intervention.",
      "motive": "The motive behind Kazuha's attack was twofold. Firstly, the perpetrator needed to eliminate a potential witness who might have seen or deduced too much about the true nature of Nobukazu's murder. Kazuha's presence and her determined search for clues posed a threat to the carefully crafted plan. Secondly, by creating a scene that mirrored the earlier murder, the assailant aimed to heighten the confusion and terror among the remaining guests and investigators at the mansion. This act of violence served to reinforce the idea of a supernatural curse or a methodical killer still at large, thereby diverting attention away from the true perpetrator and their underlying motives.",
