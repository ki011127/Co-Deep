            "content": "Helen recounted the events leading up to Julia's death. Julia had recently gotten engaged and began hearing strange noises at night—a low whistle followed by a crackling sound. These sounds disturbed her greatly, but she couldn't determine their source. One fateful night, Julia let out a terrifying scream and ran into Helen's room. She collapsed on the floor and uttered the words 'stained string' before passing away."

            "content": "Shortly after Helen left, the atmosphere in Holmes' office became tense. Dr. Grimsby Roylott burst through the door with a furious expression on his face. His towering figure and wild eyes made an immediate impression on both Holmes and Watson. Without wasting any time, he began to shout threats at them, demanding that they stay out of his personal matters. To emphasize his point, he grabbed a fireplace poker and bent it effortlessly with his bare hands, showcasing his immense strength."

Watson, though slightly intimidated, stood by Holmes' side, ready to support him if needed. The room was filled with a palpable tension as Roylott continued to rage, but Holmes' unflinching demeanor seemed to unsettle him. After delivering his warning, Roylott stormed out of the office just as abruptly as he had entered, leaving behind an air of menace and a bent poker as a stark reminder of his threat."

Helen and Julia's father had left a considerable fortune, but it was tied up in a trust that only allowed limited access.

He had accumulated significant debts over the years due to his reckless spending and poor investments. It became clear that he stood to gain a substantial amount of money if Helen and Julia remained unmarried. If either of them married, they would inherit a portion of the fortune, leaving Roylott with even less control over the finances."

This unusual feature immediately caught Holmes' attention. He suspected that this vent might have played a crucial role in whatever had happened to Julia. Its strategic placement made it possible for sounds or even objects to pass between the rooms without anyone noticing."

However, upon closer inspection, Holmes discovered that it was non-functional. It did not connect to any bell system in the house. This peculiar detail puzzled both Holmes and Watson. Why would there be a bell pull that served no purpose? Its position right above the bed seemed too deliberate to be a mere coincidence."

This meant that whoever slept in it had no choice but to stay in that exact spot every night. The fixed bed, combined with the vent and the non-functional bell pull, painted a disturbing picture in Holmes' mind."

To achieve this, he repeated his plan with Helen, but Holmes intervened just in time."

He noticed the ventilator and the bell-pull that didn't work, which led him to suspect the use of a snake. With this knowledge, Holmes set a trap and confirmed his suspicions when the snake returned through the ventilator. Dr. Roylott's plan was foiled, ensuring Helen's safety and bringing justice for Julia."
